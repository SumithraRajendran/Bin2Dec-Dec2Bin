#Importing the Library:

#At the beginning, we’re telling Python to use a special toolbox of code called tkinter. It’s like a kit that helps us make windows and buttons in our program.

#Functions for Conversion:

#We define two functions:

#decimal_to_binary(): This function takes a regular number (decimal) and turns it into a binary number. For example, it changes 10 to “1010”.

#binary_to_decimal(): This function takes a binary number and turns it into a regular number. So, “1010” becomes 10.

#Clearing Output:

#We also have a function called clear_output(). This one just cleans up the space where the result appears.

#Creating the Window:

#We create the main window (the program’s screen) and give it a name, “Binary-Decimal Converter”.

#Buttons for Conversion:

#We make a little section at the top with buttons: “Decimal to Binary” and “Binary to Decimal”. These buttons will help us choose what kind of conversion we want to do.

#Input Field:

#Then we create a spot where you can type in a number. It’s like a text box.

#Convert Button:

#Next is a “Convert” button. Right now, it doesn’t do anything, but we’ll make it work soon.

#Output Label:

#Below that, there’s a spot where the result will show up. It starts out empty.

#Putting Everything Together:

#The root.mainloop() part keeps the window open. It’s like saying, “Hey, computer, show this window and let us click buttons and type things.”
